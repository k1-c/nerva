# Conventional Commit Skill

This skill helps create commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Instructions

You are a commit message assistant. Your task is to analyze the current changes and create a well-formatted commit message following the Conventional Commits specification.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Analyze Changes**: First, run `git status` and `git diff --staged` (or `git diff` if nothing is staged) to understand what has been changed.

2. **Determine the Commit Type**: Based on the changes, select the appropriate type:

   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation only changes
   - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
   - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
   - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
   - `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
   - `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
   - `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

3. **Identify the Scope** (optional): Determine if there's a specific component, module, or area affected.

4. **Write the Description**: Create a concise description in imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature").

5. **Add Body** (if needed): For complex changes, add a body explaining:

   - The motivation for the change
   - Contrast with previous behavior

6. **Add Footer** (if needed): Include any breaking changes or issue references.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples

Simple commit:

```
feat: add user authentication
```

With scope:

```
fix(parser): handle empty input gracefully
```

With body and footer:

```
feat(api): add endpoint for user preferences

Add a new REST endpoint that allows users to save and retrieve
their application preferences. This enables persistent settings
across sessions.

BREAKING CHANGE: The /settings endpoint has been renamed to /preferences
Closes #123
```

### Important Rules

- Keep the first line (header) under 72 characters
- Use lowercase for type and scope
- Do not end the description with a period
- Use imperative mood in the description
- Separate header from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Do NOT include auto-generated footers (e.g., "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By")

### Semantic Commit Splitting

When staged or unstaged changes span multiple logical concerns, split them into separate atomic commits. Each commit should represent a single semantic unit of change.

#### How to Split

1. **Classify changes by type and scope**: Group related hunks by their commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) and scope. Changes with different types or scopes should generally be separate commits.

2. **Use `git add -p` or specific file paths**: Stage only the files/hunks belonging to one logical unit, commit, then repeat for the next unit.

3. **Commit order**: Apply commits in dependency order — infrastructure/config first, then code changes, then documentation.

#### When to Split

- Different commit types (e.g., `feat` + `docs` + `chore`) → split
- Same type but different scopes (e.g., `fix(parser)` + `fix(api)`) → split
- Logically independent changes in the same file → split using `git add -p`

#### When NOT to Split

- A feature and its directly related tests → single `feat` commit
- A code change and the minimal doc update it requires → single commit
- Closely coupled changes that would break the build if separated → single commit

#### Workflow with Multiple Commits

Present the user with a numbered plan:

```
Changes detected across multiple concerns:

1. docs: update CLAUDE.md project structure
   - CLAUDE.md

2. chore: add symlinks for public skills
   - .claude/skills/conventional-commit
   - .claude/skills/create-slides

Proceed with this plan? (y/n/modify)
```

After confirmation, execute each commit sequentially. If the user wants to modify the grouping, adjust accordingly.

### Interactive Workflow

After analyzing the changes, present the user with:

1. A summary of what changed
2. If changes span multiple concerns, a split plan (see above)
3. The proposed commit message(s)
4. Ask for confirmation or modifications before executing

If the user provides additional context or wants changes, adjust the message accordingly.
